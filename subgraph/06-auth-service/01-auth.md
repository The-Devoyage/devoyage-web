## Auth Features

Using WebAuthN or Passkeys to protect or organize user data is quick and painless with Subgraph. The
service provides built in functionality to perform a majority of day to day authentication and authorization needs.

### User Authentication

WebAuthN or Passkeys are one of the easist ways for users to authenticate their identity. The user takes advantage
of their device's authentication techniques to authenticate themselves to the Subgrpah Server.

In most cases, it is as easy as a finger print or face scan to log the user in.

### User Authorization

Once logged in, subgraph can identify and verify the idenity of the user when performing actions such as reading, editing, or updating data.
