## An Upgraded API

Whether you choose to link your existing database or embark on a new conceptual venture, Subgraph empowers you to transform ideas into fully functional applications within minutes.

## Save Development Time

The traditional approach for API design, testing, and documentation can demand weeks, months, or even years of investment before seeing usable results. Subgraph enables you to create a standardized, documented, and flexible API instantly, guided by a straightforward configuration file you craft based on the shape of your data.

## Fast, Reliable, and Easy to Configure

Built in Rust and compatible with a wide variety of data sources, Subgraph works by looking at the shape of your data to dynamically build an API centered around data retrieval, modification, and creation.

In short, you get an instantly consumable GraphQL API. Spend time working on your business logic, not code logic.
